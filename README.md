Om's website

This is a website I made for my friend Om Patel

How to get it working
======================

1) download the repo

2) u need to have codeigniter installed on your server, for this website to function properly, as it uses codeigniter framework (a PHP framework).

3) move the file "uvnationemail.php" to the controllers directory of codeigniter.

4) open file "contact.php" and search for the "igniter/index.php" in the file.

5) replace the location with the place where u placed "uvnationemail.php".

6) I routed my codeigniter's "index.php" to "uvnationemail.php", that's why u see "index.php" in my file.

7) if u find trouble setting it up, contact me.
